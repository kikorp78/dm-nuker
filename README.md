# DM Nuker

Project I created while learning Rust. No idea how you came across it, but if you need it then feel free to use it.

## How to use

1. Go to the releases page and downloaded the correct file for your OS and extract it.
2. Put your user token in the config.toml file.
3. Run the program using the command prompt or terminal.

Usage: `./dm-nuker [options] <channel ID>`

If you want to see all possible options, use the -h flag (ex. `./dm-nuker -h`).
